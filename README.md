# Space-Battleship
A game similar to Battleship, where 5 ships of different sizes and patterns are randomly laid out on a 10-by-12 grid. The rows of the grid are labeled 0 through 9, and the columns are labeled A through L. Target the ships by entering the row and column of the location you wish to shoot. A ship is destroyed when all of the spaces it fills have been hit.



View Example Map:
When you view an example map you will be able to see the various examples of how the different ships can be laid out.



New Game:
When starting a new game the default board will be printed asking where you wish to target first. Taking the row and column as an input (i.e '6G').


When you input a target and there are no ships at that location 'o' will be filled in that space indicating a miss. If there is a ship located in that position an 'x' will be filled indicating a hit.



Hall of Fame:
This feature is meant to be a scoreboard filled with the best scores. This section is still being worked on.
